# 🧬 DAY 7 — From Sanitized Data to Interactive Dashboard

---

## 🧭 Overview

Congratulations — you’ve reached the final day!  
Today, you’ll integrate every concept you’ve practiced this week into one seamless workflow:  
from **raw sanitization data** all the way to a **hosted, interactive AI-assisted dashboard**.

Your deliverable will simulate a real-world healthcare compliance report that decision-makers can interact with.  
This project demonstrates your end-to-end capability in **AI context engineering, data automation, visualization, and deployment**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 7, you’ll be able to:

- Combine **cleaning, triggers, and prompts** into a unified project.  
- Use **Streamlit + Plotly Studio** to present dynamic healthcare insights.  
- Integrate **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** logic for contextual summaries.  
- Polish and deploy a professional dashboard with proper documentation.  
- Present your final product like a portfolio case study for recruiters or clients.

## 🧩 Deliverable Checklist

| ✅ Item | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Mito-cleaned Data** | Import, cleanse, and normalize using Mito Labs. |
| **Python Trigger Logic** | Automate anomaly detection and quality checks. |
| **RAG Context Prompts** | Summarize compliance or infection trends from real-world data. |
| **Streamlit App Published** | Host the dashboard locally or via Base44. |
| **README.md** | Include badges, architecture diagrams, and AI prompt summaries. |

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Integration

### **Step 1 — Load and Clean Data**
Start with your raw report (`TG_Product_Activity_2025.xlsx`).

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("data/TG_Product_Activity_2025.xlsx")

cleaned = (
    df.dropna()
      .drop_duplicates()
      .rename(columns=str.strip)
)
cleaned.to_excel("data/cleaned_output.xlsx", index=False)
print("✅ Data cleaned and ready.")
````

---

### **Step 2 — Apply Trigger Logic**

Automate quality validation:

```python
anomalies = len(df) - len(cleaned)
print(f"⚠️  Anomalies detected and removed: {anomalies}")

summary = cleaned.describe(include='all')
summary.to_csv("data/data_summary.csv")
```

---

### **Step 3 — Generate AI-Driven Insights (RAG Simulation)**

Add a text generation cell or AI call (can be manual if offline):

```python
prompt = """
You are an AI compliance assistant. Using the summary statistics, 
identify which departments show the highest sanitizer usage, 
potential anomalies, and improvement opportunities.
"""

# Example simulated AI output
print("🤖 AI Summary:\nICU shows above-average sanitizer usage; suggest reviewing supply schedules.")
```

---

### **Step 4 — Build the Streamlit Dashboard**

```python
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

st.set_page_config(page_title="Infection Control Dashboard", layout="wide")

st.title("🧴 Infection Control Dashboard — Final Project")

df = pd.read_excel("data/cleaned_output.xlsx")

fig = px.bar(
    df,
    x="Department",
    y="Usage_Count",
    color="MaterialType",
    title="Sanitizer Usage by Department",
    text_auto=True,
    color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.sequential.Blues
)
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

st.markdown("### 🧠 AI-Generated Summary")
st.info("ICU and ER departments show higher usage rates. Recommend targeted restock audits.")
```

---

### **Step 5 — Add Interactivity**

```python
dept = st.selectbox("Filter by Department", df["Department"].unique())
subset = df[df["Department"] == dept]
st.dataframe(subset)
```

---

### **Step 6 — Visual & Thematic Polish**

Add custom colors and font:

```python
fig.update_layout(
    plot_bgcolor="#0e1117",
    paper_bgcolor="#0e1117",
    font=dict(family="Roboto", color="#E5E7EB"),
    title_font=dict(size=22, color="#93C5FD")
)
```

---

### **Step 7 — Deployment**

Export from Mito or commit your Streamlit app to GitHub, then host via Base44.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Final Day7 Dashboard"
base44 deploy
```

Expected output:

```
✅ Build complete!
🌐 Dashboard live at: https://base44.app/infection-control-dashboard
```

## 🧪 Mini-Capstone Challenge

Create a **“Compliance Command Center”** prototype:

* Display sanitizer usage by department (bar chart).
* Add an AI-generated summary card at the bottom.
* Include a download button for CSV exports.
* Host on Base44 and record a short screen-capture walkthrough.

---

## 💬 Reflection

Ask yourself:

* Which part of the pipeline (cleaning, coding, visualization, deployment) felt most natural?
* How might this process scale to multi-hospital systems or IoT data streams?
* What would a *next-generation* version of this dashboard include (AI forecasting, alerting, or sentiment analysis)?
